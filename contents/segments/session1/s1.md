### The Zen of Python

# The Art of the Sage to tame this Snake ✨

**What is "The Zen of Python"?**
<v-clicks depth="2">

*  A collection of **19 guiding principles** for writing good Python code.
*  Written by **Tim Peters**, a Python guru.
*  Accessible by typing `import this` in any Python interpreter.
*  Embodies the philosophy behind Python's design and encourages;
    1.   **Readability,** 
    2.   **Simplicity,** and 
    3.   **Clarity.**

### The Zen of Python - Principle 1

# Beautiful is better than ugly. ✨

**Principle 1: "Beautiful is better than ugly."**

<v-clicks depth="2">

*   Python emphasizes **code elegance and aesthetics.**
*   Strive to write code that is not just *functional* but also **pleasing to read and understand.**
*   Ugly code might work, but **beautiful code is maintainable, collaborative, and a joy to work with.**

</v-clicks>

```python
""" The Frog  🐸 """
def calculate_value(a,b,c,d,e,f):
    val= (a*b + c**2) / (d-e) + f
    return val
```

```python
""" The Prince 🤴🏽"""
def calculate_total_price(quantity, price, tax_rate, discount, shipping_cost, extra_fee):
    total = (quantity * price * (1 + tax_rate) - discount) + shipping_cost + extra_fee

<!-- ### The Zen of Python - Principle 1 -->

# Beautiful is better than ugly. ✨
Which example is easier to understand at a glance, even without comments? **Why?** -->

**Example (Ugly - less readable):**


```python{all|1|2|3|all}
def calculate_value(a,b,c,d,e,f): # What do a,b,c... represent?
    val= (a*b + c**2) / (d-e) + f
    return val
```

**Example (Beautiful - more readable):**
```python{all|1|2|3|all}
def calculate_total_price(quantity, price, tax_rate, discount, shipping_cost, extra_fee):
    total = (quantity * price * (1 + tax_rate) - discount) + shipping_cost + extra_fee
    return total

### The Zen of Python - Principle 2
# Explicit is better than implicit. 🔍
**Principle 2: "Explicit is better than implicit."**

<v-clicks>

*   Python favors code where **things are stated clearly and directly.**
*   Avoid "magic" or hidden behavior that is not immediately obvious from the code itself.
*   **Clarity over cleverness.**  Code should be easy to understand *at first glance*, not require deep investigation to figure out what's happening.

</v-clicks>

<!-- ### The Zen of Python - Principle 2 -->

# Explicit is better than implicit. 🔍
In the **"Explicit"** example, how is the `increment()` method more explicit? What about the method name `get_count()`?
::left::

**Example (Implicit - less explicit):**

```python{all|none|6,7|9|14|all}
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self._count = 0

    def increment(self):
        # Implicit: we just increment, no return
        self._count += 1 

    def value(self):
        return self._count

my_counter = Counter()
my_counter.increment()
print(my_counter.value()) 
```
::right::

**Example (Explicit - more explicit):**
```python{all|none|7|9|13|14|all}
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self._count = 0

    def increment(self):
        self._count += 1
        return self._count # Explicit: increment returns the new count

    def get_count(self): # More explicit name
        return self._count

my_counter = Counter()
new_count = my_counter.increment() # Explicitly capture returned value
print(new_count) # Directly see the incremented value

```

### The Zen of Python - Principle 3
# Simple is better than complex.  But complex is better than complicated. 🧘
**Principle 3: "Simple is better than complex. But complex is better than complicated."**

<v-clicks depth="2">

* **Start simple:**  Aim for the **most straightforward solution** that solves the problem.
* **Avoid unnecessary complexity.**  Don't over-engineer or add features you don't need *yet*.
* **"Simple" doesn't mean underpowered.**  Simple code can be very effective and robust.
* **Complexity is sometimes necessary.**  For inherently complex problems, embrace complexity *when needed*, but keep it **organized and well-managed.**
* **"Complicated" is the enemy.**  Complicated code is tangled, hard to understand, and error-prone.  Avoid unnecessary cleverness or obscure solutions that lead to complication.

</v-clicks>

Check the following slides and decide which approach is easier to extend if we need to add more discount rules in the future? Why?

---

<!-- ### The Zen of Python - Principle 3 -->

# Simple is better than complex.  But complex is better than complicated. 🧘
**Example (Complex/Complicated -  less simple):**

```python
# Hypothetical scenario: processing order items with many conditional checks
def process_order_item(item, user_type, is_prime_user, coupon_code, time_of_day, stock_level):
    if user_type == "VIP":
        discount_rate = 0.2
        if is_prime_user and time_of_day == "Evening":
            discount_rate += 0.1
    elif coupon_code == "SAVE15":
        discount_rate = 0.15
    elif stock_level < 10 and time_of_day == "Weekend":
        discount_rate = 0.05
    else:
        discount_rate = 0

    # ... more nested conditionals and calculations based on various factors ...
    final_price = item['price'] * (1 - discount_rate)
    return final_price
```

---

<!-- ### The Zen of Python - Principle 3 -->

# Simple is better than complex.  But complex is better than complicated. 🧘

**Example (Simple - more simple, and potentially more flexible):**

```py

# Approach: Use a dictionary to map conditions to discount rates
def calculate_discount(item, user_type, is_prime_user, coupon_code, time_of_day, stock_level):
    discounts = {
        ("VIP",): 0.2,  # VIP users get 20%
        ("VIP", True, "Evening"): 0.3, # VIP + Prime + Evening = 30%
        (None, None, "SAVE15", None, None, None): 0.15, # Coupon "SAVE15"
        (None, None, None, None, "Weekend", lambda stock: stock < 10): 0.05 # Weekend + low stock
    }

    for condition, rate in discounts.items():
        condition_tuple = tuple(val if val is not None else None for val in [user_type, is_prime_user, coupon_code, time_of_day, stock_level])
        if all( (cond is None or cond == condition_tuple[i] or (callable(cond) and cond(condition_tuple[i]))) for i, cond in enumerate(condition)): # Flexible condition matching
            return rate
    return 0 # Default no discount

def process_order_item(item, user_type, is_prime_user, coupon_code, time_of_day, stock_level):
    discount_rate = calculate_discount(item, user_type, is_prime_user, coupon_code, time_of_day, stock_level)
    final_price = item['price'] * (1 - discount_rate)
    return final_price
```

### The Zen of Python - Principle 4
# Readability counts. 👓

**Principle 4: "Readability counts."**

<v-clicks depth="2">

*   Code is read **much more often** than it is written.
*   Prioritize writing code that is **easy for humans to understand.**
*   Your code will be read by:
    *   **Your future self** (who might forget the details). 👴👵
    *   **Teammates** (collaborating on projects). 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
    *   **Maintainers** (fixing bugs or extending your code later). 🛠️
*   **Clear code reduces bugs, speeds up development, and simplifies collaboration.**

# Readability counts. 👓
Question: How does the "More Readable" example improve readability through variable names, code structure, and comments (docstring)?

::left::

**Example (Less Readable):**

```python
# Single long line, unclear logic

def process_data(input_data):
    # What is 'res'? What are we doing?
    res=[i**2 for i in input_data if i%2==0] 
    return res
```

::right::

**Example (More Readable):**
```py
def get_squares_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns a list containing the squares of even numbers 
    from the input list.
    """
    squared_even_numbers = [] # Clear variable name
    for number in numbers:   # Meaningful loop variable
        if number % 2 == 0:  # Check for even number (more explicit)
            squared_even_numbers.append(number ** 2)
    return squared_even_numbers

## Setting Up Your Python Environment - Overview

# Get Ready to Code: Your Python Toolkit 🛠️

**Before you can write and run Python code, you need to set up your development environment.**

Think of it like preparing your workspace before starting any project.  You need the right tools!



**Key steps in setting up your Python environment:**

<v-clicks>

1. **Install Python itself:**  Download and install the Python interpreter on your computer. This is the engine that runs your Python code. 🐍
2. **Choose a Code Editor (IDE):**  Select a good code editor to write and manage your Python code. We recommend **VS Code**. 💻
3. **(Optional) Set up a Virtual Environment:**  Isolate your project's dependencies to avoid conflicts.  We'll introduce this concept briefly now and cover it in detail later. 
4. **Verify your setup:**  Make sure everything is installed correctly and working! ✅

</v-clicks>

**In the next few slides, we'll guide you through each of these steps, step-by-step.         AND...... Don't worry, we'll make it as straightforward as possible!** 👍

# Installing Python - Step-by-Step (macOS) 🍎
**Let's install Python on your macOS computer.**

> **Good news for Mac users: Python might already be partially installed!** macOS comes with Python pre-installed, but it's often an older version (Python 2.x) and it's best **not to use the system Python** for development. We'll install the latest official version.

**Follow these steps:**

<v-clicks>

1.  **Open your web browser** and go to the official Python website: **[https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org)**
2.  **Hover over "Downloads"** and **click on the "Python 3.x.x" button** (the latest Python 3 version).  This will download the Python installer for macOS (.pkg file).
3.  **Run the downloaded installer (.pkg file).**
4.  **Follow the on-screen instructions in the installer.**  Usually, you can just click "Continue", "Next", "Agree", and "Install".
5.  **Wait for the installation to complete.**
6.  **Click "Close"** once the installation is successful.

</v-clicks>

**Important Note:**  We'll show you how to verify if your python version is up-to-date in the next slide.

# Installing Python - Step-by-Step (Linux) 🐧
> **Linux systems usually come with Python pre-installed, but it might be Python 2 or an older version of Python 3.**

**It's recommended to install the latest Python 3 version using your distribution's package manager using the following commands.** This is the easiest and safest way on Linux.

*   **Ubuntu/Debian (and derivatives like Linux Mint):**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update     # Update package lists
    sudo apt install python3.x # Replace x with latest version (e.g., python3.12)
    ```

*   **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**

    ```bash
    sudo dnf update    # Update package lists
    sudo dnf install python3 # Installs latest Python 3
    ```

*   **Arch Linux/Manjaro:**

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu   # Update system and package lists
    sudo pacman -S python # Installs latest Python 3
    ```
---

# Installing Python - Step-by-Step (Linux) 🐧

**Open your terminal and run the appropriate commands for your Linux distribution.**

**After installation, verify Python installation (next slide!).**

**Note for Linux:** Using the package manager ensures Python is well-integrated with your system. Avoid installing Python directly from source unless you have a specific advanced need.
---

### Verifying Python Installation ✅

# Is Python Installed Correctly? Let's Check!

**After installation, it's essential to verify that Python is installed correctly and accessible from your command line/terminal.**

**Open your command line (Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell, macOS/Linux: Terminal).**

**Type the following command and press Enter:**

```bash
python3 --version
```

**What you should see:**
* If Python 3 is correctly installed and in your system's PATH, you will see the Python version number printed on the screen.  For example:

```bash
Python 3.12.1
```

_The exact version number might be slightly different depending on the version you installed, but it should start with Python 3._
---

### Verifying Python Installation ✅

# Is Python Installed Correctly? Let's Check!
**If you see an error message like "python3: command not found" or "'python3' is not recognized..."**

- It means Python is not correctly installed or not in your system's PATH.
- **On Windows:** Go back to the installation steps and make sure you checked **"Add Python x.x to PATH"** during installation. Reinstall if needed, ensuring that option is checked.
- **On macOS/Linux:** If you used the package manager (recommended), Python should be in your PATH automatically. If you still have issues, double-check the installation commands for your specific distribution.

---

### Verifying Python Installation ✅

# Is Python Installed Correctly? Let's Check!

**Troubleshooting Tip:**
- Sometimes, on some systems, you might need to use `python` instead of `python3` in the command. If `python3 --version` doesn't work, try:

```bash
python --version
```

However, it's generally best practice to use `python3` to specifically call Python 3, especially if older Python 2 is also present on the system.

**Once you see the Python version printed, congratulations! Python is successfully installed!** 🎉

### Basic Python Syntax in Jupyter - Variables 
# Python Basics in Jupyter: Variables

**Let's start learning some basic Python syntax directly in your Jupyter Notebook!**

::left::
**Variables:  Storing Information**

*   In programming, a **variable** is like a named container that holds a value.
*   You can think of it as a label you attach to <br> some data so you can refer to it later.
*   **Assigning a value to a variable** is how you store information in it.

*   In Python, you **don't need to declare**
<br> **the type** of a variable explicitly. Python automatically figures out the type based <br> on the value you assign.

::right::


**Example in Jupyter Code Cell:**

```python
# Assigning a value to a variable named 'message'
message = "Hello Python Variables!"

# Assigning a number to a variable named 'number'
number = 10

# You can then use the variable name 
# to access the stored value
print(message)
print(number)
```

### Basic Python Syntax in Jupyter - Variables 
# Python Basics in Jupyter: Variables

::left::
**Try it in your Jupyter Notebook!**
  
  1.  In a new code cell in your Jupyter Notebook, type the code above.
  2.  Run the cell (Shift+Enter or Ctrl+Enter).
  3.  What output do you see? Do you see the message and the number printed?

::right::

**Variable Naming Rules in Python (Important):**
- Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
- They must start with a letter or an underscore, not a digit.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (message is different from Message).
- Choose descriptive and meaningful variable names to improve readability (Zen of Python!).

**Next, we'll briefly look at different data types in Python.**

## Basic Python Syntax in Jupyter - Data Types (Quick Look) 🧐

# Python Basics in Jupyter: Data Types (Quick Look)

**Every value in Python has a "data type" that determines what kind of data it is and what you can do with it.**

**Let's take a quick look at some fundamental data types in Python:**
::left::
*   **Integers (int):** Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimal points.
    *   Examples: `10`, `-5`, `0`, `1000`
*   **Floating-point numbers (float):** <br> Numbers with decimal points.
    *   Examples: `3.14`, `-2.5`, `0.0`, `1.2e5`  (scientific notation)

::right::

*   **Strings (str):**  Sequences of characters, representing text. Enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`).
    *   Examples: `"Hello"`, `'Python'`, `"123"`, `"This is a sentence."`
*   **Booleans (bool):** Represent truth values: `True` or `False`.
    *   Used in logical operations and conditions.

## Basic Python Syntax in Jupyter - Data Types (Quick Look) 🧐

# Python Basics in Jupyter: Data Types (Quick Look)

**Example in Jupyter Code Cell - Exploring Data Types:**

::left::
```python
# Examples of different data types
integer_number = 25
floating_number = 3.14159
text_string = "Python is fun!"
is_true = True

# Use the type() function 
# to check the data type of a variable
print(type(integer_number))
print(type(floating_number))
print(type(text_string))
print(type(is_true))
```
::right::
**Try it in your Jupyter Notebook!**
1. In a new code cell, type the code above.
2. Run the cell.
3. What output do you see? Do you see the data types printed for each variable?

**Understanding data types is fundamental in programming. We'll explore them in more detail in later sessions.**

**Next:  Let's talk about organizing your Python projects! 📂**

### Organizing Your Python Projects - Project Folders 📂
# Organize Your Code: Project Folders

**As you start writing more Python code, especially for larger projects, it's crucial to organize your files effectively.**

**Using Project Folders is essential for:**

*   **Organization:** Keep all related files for a project together in one place. No scattered scripts! 🗂️
*   **Maintainability:** Easier to find, understand, and update your code when it's well-organized. 🛠️
*   **Collaboration:** Easier to work on team projects together when everyone knows where to find things. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
*   **Avoiding Clutter:**  Keeps your main directories clean and prevents a jumble of unrelated Python files. ✨

### Organizing Your Python Projects - Project Folders 📂
# Organize Your Code: Project Folders


::left::
**Best Practice: Create a dedicated folder for each Python project.**

*   Choose a meaningful name for your <br> project folder (e.g., `my_python_project`, `data_analysis_script`, `web_app`).
*   Place all Python files (`.py` files), Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files), data files, and any other related resources for that project <br> *inside* this folder.

::right::

**Example Project Folder Structure:**
```bash
my_python_project/  # <-- Project root folder
├── hello.py        # Main Python script (optional)
├── notebooks/      # Folder for Jupyter Notebooks (optional)
│   ├── data_exploration.ipynb
│   └── analysis.ipynb
├── data/           # Folder for data files (optional)
│   └── input_data.csv
└── README.md       # Project description (good practice!)
```

**In VS Code, open your project folder as the "workspace".** This gives VS Code context about your project and helps with navigation and features.

**Next, we'll talk about the `main.py` entry point in a project.** 🚀
---
layout: two-cols-header

## Basic Project Structure - `main.py` Entry Point 🚀
# Project Structure: `main.py` as the Entry Point

**For many Python projects, especially scripts and applications, it's a good practice to have a `main.py` file at the root of your project folder.**

::left::
**What is `main.py`?**

*   **The "starting point" of your program.** When you run your project, Python often executes the code in `main.py` first.
*   **Contains the primary logic or entry point** to your application or script.
*   **Not always required**, especially for simple scripts or libraries, but it's a common convention for larger projects.

::right::
**Example Project Structure (with `main.py`):**
```bash
my_python_project/
├── main.py        # <-- Main entry point script!
├── utils.py       # Helper functions (modules)
├── data/
│   └── input.txt
└── README.md
```
---
layout: two-cols-header
---

## Basic Project Structure - `main.py` Entry Point 🚀
# Project Structure: `main.py` as the Entry Point

::left::

**How to use `main.py`:**

*   **Put your main program logic inside `main.py`.**  This could include:
    *   Function calls that start your application.
    *   Parsing command-line arguments.
    *   Setting up initial configurations.
    *   Importing and using functions from other modules in your project (like `utils.py`).

*   **Run `main.py` from the command line:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
::right::

>    (Make sure your terminal is in the root directory of your project folder where `main.py` is located).

**Why `main.py`?**

*   **Clarity:**  Immediately obvious where to start running or looking at the main program logic.
*   **Organization:**  Separates main execution flow from supporting modules or utility code.
*   **Standard convention:**  Recognized by many Python tools and frameworks.

**Next, we'll briefly introduce the concept of Version Control and Git!** 🗂️

### Introduction to Version Control - Why It Matters 🕰️
# Introduction to Version Control:  Track Your Changes

**As you write more code, you'll make changes, fix bugs, add new features.  How do you keep track of all these changes and manage your project's history?**

**This is where Version Control comes in!**

**What is Version Control?**

*   A system that **records changes to your files over time** so you can recall specific versions later.
*   Think of it like a detailed "history book" for your project. 📖
*   Allows you to:
    *   **Go back to previous versions** of your code if something goes wrong. ⏪
    *   **Track who made what changes and when.** 👤
    *   **Collaborate with others** on the same project without chaos. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
    *   **Experiment with new features** in isolated branches without breaking the main codebase. 🧪

### Introduction to Version Control - Why It Matters 🕰️
# Introduction to Version Control:  Track Your Changes

**Why is Version Control essential for software development?**

*   **Manages complexity:**  Software projects evolve, version control helps handle the increasing complexity.
*   **Enables collaboration:**  Teams can work together efficiently and avoid conflicts.
*   **Facilitates experimentation and bug fixing:**  Safely try new things and easily revert to stable versions.
*   **Provides a safety net:**  Protect your work from accidental deletions or errors.
*   **Industry standard:**  Version control is used in virtually all professional software development projects.

**In the next slide, we'll briefly introduce Git, a popular Version Control System.** 🚀

### Version Control with Git - A Sneak Peek 🚀
# Version Control with Git: A Sneak Peek

**There are many Version Control Systems, but one of the most popular and widely used is called Git.**

**What is Git?**

*   **A powerful and flexible Version Control System.**
*   **Tracks changes in your files** (code, documents, etc.) over time.
*   **Allows you to create "snapshots"** of your project at different points in history (these are called "commits").
*   **Enables branching and merging:**  Work on different features or fixes in parallel branches, then merge them back together.
*   **Designed for collaboration:**  Makes it easy for teams to work on the same codebase.
*   **Used by the vast majority of software development teams and open-source projects worldwide.**

### Version Control with Git - A Sneak Peek 🚀
# Version Control with Git: A Sneak Peek

**Key Git Concepts (we'll explore these in detail in a later session):**

*   **Repository ("repo"):**  The folder where Git stores your project's history and files.
*   **Commit:**  A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, with a message describing the changes.
*   **Branch:**  A parallel version of your project, allowing for isolated development.
*   **Merge:**  Combining changes from one branch into another.
*   **Remote Repository:**  A repository hosted on a server (like GitHub, GitLab) for collaboration and backup.

**Git can seem a bit complex at first, but its benefits are immense!**
