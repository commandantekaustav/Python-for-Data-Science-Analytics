### ðŸš€ Advanced NumPy Techniques for pandas - Vectorization and Broadcasting âš¡

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's begin by understanding broadcasting.

::left::

**1. Broadcasting:**

* Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays with different shapes.
* NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array.
* This avoids the need for explicit loops and improves performance.

::right::

**Example: Broadcasting**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([[10], [20], [30]])

# Broadcasting addition
result = arr1 + arr2
print("Broadcasting Result:\n", result)
```

### ðŸš€ Advanced NumPy Techniques for pandas - Vectorization and Broadcasting âš¡

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's see the output of broadcasting.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 2):**
```bash
Broadcasting Result:
 [[11 12 13]
 [21 22 23]
 [31 32 33]]
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `arr1` (1D array) and `arr2` (2D array) have different shapes.
* NumPy broadcasts `arr1` to match the shape of `arr2`, effectively adding `[1, 2, 3]` to each row of `arr2`.
* Broadcasting simplifies operations on arrays with different shapes and improves performance.

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's delve deeper into vectorization.

::left::

**2. Vectorization for Speed:**

* Vectorization applies operations to entire arrays, eliminating the need for explicit loops.
* NumPy operations are vectorized by default, making them much faster than Python loops.
* This is crucial for efficient data manipulation in pandas.

::right::

**Example: Vectorization vs. Loop**

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Sample array
arr = np.random.rand(1000000)

# Vectorized operation
start_vec = time.time()
squared_arr_vec = arr ** 2
end_vec = time.time()
print("Vectorized Time:", end_vec - start_vec)

# Loop operation
start_loop = time.time()
squared_arr_loop = [x ** 2 for x in arr]
end_loop = time.time()
print("Loop Time:", end_loop - start_loop)
```

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's see the output of the vectorization vs. loop example.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 4):**
```bash
Vectorized Time: 0.002 seconds (approx.)
Loop Time: 0.3 seconds (approx.)
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* The vectorized operation (`arr ** 2`) is significantly faster than the loop operation.
* NumPy's vectorization eliminates the overhead of Python loops.
* This demonstrates the performance benefits of using NumPy's vectorized operations in pandas.
* The exact times can vary depending on hardware, but the vectorized version is always much faster.

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's explore how to use broadcasting with pandas.

::left::

**3. Broadcasting with pandas:**

* Broadcasting is used internally by pandas for many operations.
* You can leverage broadcasting to perform efficient operations on pandas Series and DataFrames.

::right::

**Example: Broadcasting with pandas Series**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample Series
series = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Broadcasting addition
result = series + 10
print("Broadcasting with Series:\n", result)
```

### ðŸš€ Advanced NumPy Techniques for pandas - Vectorization and Broadcasting âš¡

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's see the output of broadcasting with pandas Series.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 6):**
```bash
Broadcasting with Series:
 0    11
1    12
2    13
3    14
4    15
dtype: int64
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `series + 10` adds the scalar value 10 to each element of the pandas Series.
* This is an example of broadcasting, where the scalar value is effectively broadcasted to match the shape of the Series.
* pandas leverages NumPy's broadcasting capabilities for efficient Series and DataFrame operations.

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's explore how to use broadcasting with pandas DataFrames.

::left::

**4. Broadcasting with pandas DataFrames:**

* Broadcasting can be used to perform operations between DataFrames and Series or scalar values.
* This allows for efficient element-wise operations across rows or columns.

::right::

**Example: Broadcasting with pandas DataFrame**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4), columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
print("Original DataFrame:\n", df)

# Broadcasting addition
result = df + [1, 2, 3, 4]
print("\nBroadcasting with DataFrame:\n", result)
```

### ðŸš€ Advanced NumPy Techniques for pandas - Vectorization and Broadcasting âš¡

**Efficient Data Manipulation and Performance Optimization**

Let's see the output of broadcasting with pandas DataFrames.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 8):**
```bash
Original DataFrame:
    A   B   C   D
0   0   1   2   3
1   4   5   6   7
2   8   9  10  11

Broadcasting with DataFrame:
    A   B   C   D
0   1   3   5   7
1   5   7   9  11
2   9  11  13  15
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `df + [1, 2, 3, 4]` adds the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` to each row of the DataFrame.
* This demonstrates how pandas leverages broadcasting to perform efficient operations on DataFrames.
* The list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is broadcasted to match the shape of the DataFrame, adding each element to the corresponding column.

print("Vectorized Time:", end_vec - start_vec)

# Using a Python loop (less efficient)
start_loop = time.time()
result_loop = [np.sin(x) for x in series]
end_loop = time.time()
print("Loop Time:", end_loop - start_loop)
```
