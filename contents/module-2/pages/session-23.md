### üßΩ pandas Data Cleaning - String Operations and Typos Correction ‚úçÔ∏è

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's start by exploring how to clean and transform text data using pandas string methods.

::left::

**1. Cleaning and Transforming Text Data:**

* pandas provides a set of string methods that can be applied to Series and DataFrames to clean and transform text data.
* These methods are accessed using the `.str` attribute.
* Common string operations include:
    * Case conversion (`lower()`, `upper()`, `title()`)
    * Removing whitespace (`strip()`, `lstrip()`, `rstrip()`)
    * Replacing substrings (`replace()`)
    * Splitting strings (`split()`)
    * Concatenating strings (`cat()`)

::right::

**Example: Cleaning and Transforming Text Data**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample Series with text data
data = pd.Series(['  Hello World  ', 'pYTHON is Fun', 
                    'data SCIENCE'])
print("Original Series:\n", data)

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace
cleaned_data = data.str.strip()
print("\nCleaned Series:\n", cleaned_data)

# Convert to lowercase
lowercase_data = cleaned_data.str.lower()
print("\nLowercase Series:\n", lowercase_data)
```

### üßΩ pandas Data Cleaning - String Operations and Typos Correction ‚úçÔ∏è

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's see the output of cleaning and transforming text data.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 2):**
```bash
Original Series:
0      Hello World  
1       pYTHON is Fun
2         data SCIENCE
dtype: object

Cleaned Series:
0      Hello World
1       pYTHON is Fun
2         data SCIENCE
dtype: object

Lowercase Series:
0      hello world
1       python is fun
2         data science
dtype: object
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `data.str.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace from each string in the Series.
* `cleaned_data.str.lower()` converts all characters in the cleaned strings to lowercase.
* These operations help standardize the text data by removing unnecessary whitespace and ensuring consistent case.

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's explore how to remove noise from text data.

::left::

**2. Removing Noise:**

* Text data often contains noise such as extra whitespace, punctuation, and special characters that can interfere with analysis.
* You can use string methods like `strip()`, `replace()`, and regular expressions to remove this noise.

::right::

**Example: Removing Noise**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample Series with noisy text data
data = pd.Series(['  Hello! World?  ', 'pYTHON, is. Fun!', 'data SCIENCE  '])
print("Original Series:\n", data)

# Remove punctuation and special characters
cleaned_data = data.str.replace(r'[^\w\s]', '', regex=True)
print("\nCleaned Series (no punctuation):\n", cleaned_data)

# Remove extra whitespace
cleaned_data = cleaned_data.str.replace(r'\s+', ' ', regex=True).str.strip()
print("\nCleaned Series (no extra whitespace):\n", cleaned_data)
```

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's see the output of removing noise from text data.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 4):**
```bash
Original Series:
0      Hello! World?  
1       pYTHON, is. Fun!
2         data SCIENCE  
dtype: object

Cleaned Series (no punctuation):
0       Hello World  
1       pYTHON is Fun 
2         data SCIENCE  
dtype: object

Cleaned Series (no extra whitespace):
0    Hello World
1    pYTHON is Fun
2    data SCIENCE
dtype: object
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `data.str.replace(r'[^\w\s]', '', regex=True)` removes punctuation and special characters from the strings. The regular expression `[^\w\s]` matches any character that is not a word character (`\w`) or a whitespace character (`\s`).
* `cleaned_data.str.replace(r'\s+', ' ', regex=True).str.strip()` removes extra whitespace. The regular expression `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters, which are then replaced with a single space. Finally, `.str.strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace.

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's explore how to convert case, split, and join strings.

::left::

**3. Case Conversion, Splitting, and Joining:**

* Case conversion, splitting, and joining are common text manipulation tasks used to standardize and structure text data.
* pandas provides methods for these operations:
    * Case conversion: `lower()`, `upper()`, `title()`
    * Splitting: `split()`
    * Joining: `join()`

::right::

**Example: Case Conversion, Splitting, and Joining**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample Series with text data
data = pd.Series(['Hello World', 'Python is Fun', 'Data Science'])
print("Original Series:\n", data)

# Convert to title case
title_case_data = data.str.title()
print("\nTitle Case Series:\n", title_case_data)

# Split strings into words
split_data = data.str.split()
print("\nSplit Series:\n", split_data)

# Join words back into a string
joined_data = split_data.str.join(' ')
print("\nJoined Series:\n", joined_data)
```

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**


Let's see the output of case conversion, splitting, and joining strings.

**Explanation:**

* `data.str.title()` converts the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
* `data.str.split()` splits each string into a list of words, using whitespace as the delimiter.
* `split_data.str.join(' ')` joins the list of words back into a single string, using a space as the separator. In this case, it effectively reverses the split operation, resulting in the original strings.

::right::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 6):**
```bash
Original Series:
0      Hello World
1     Python is Fun
2       Data Science
dtype: object

Title Case Series:
0      Hello World
1     Python Is Fun
2       Data Science
dtype: object

Split Series:
0        [Hello, World]
1       [Python, is, Fun]
2         [Data, Science]
dtype: object

Joined Series:
0      Hello World

### üßΩ pandas Data Cleaning - String Operations and Typos Correction ‚úçÔ∏è

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's explore how to extract information with regular expressions.

::left::

**4. Extracting Information with Regular Expressions:**

* Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation.
* pandas integrates with Python's `re` module to allow you to apply regular expressions to Series and DataFrames using the `.str.extract()` and `.str.extractall()` methods.

::right::

**Example: Extracting Information with Regular Expressions**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample Series with text data
data = pd.Series(['Name: John, Age: 25', 'Name: Alice, Age: 30', 'Name: Bob, Age: 28'])
print("Original Series:\n", data)

# Extract names and ages using regular expressions
extracted_data = data.str.extract(r'Name: (\w+), Age: (\d+)')
print("\nExtracted Data:\n", extracted_data)

# Name the extracted columns
extracted_data.columns = ['Name', 'Age']
print("\nExtracted Data with Column Names:\n", extracted_data)
```

Let's see the output of extracting information with regular expressions.

**Output & Explanation (Slide 8):**
```bash
Original Series:
0      Name: John, Age: 25
1     Name: Alice, Age: 30
2       Name: Bob, Age: 28
dtype: object

Extracted Data:
      0   1
0  John  25
1  Alice  30
2    Bob  28

Extracted Data with Column Names:
    Name Age
0   John  25
1  Alice  30
2    Bob  28
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `data.str.extract(r'Name: (\w+), Age: (\d+)')` extracts the name and age from each string using a regular expression.
* The regular expression `Name: (\w+), Age: (\d+)` defines two capturing groups:
    * `(\w+)` captures one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) for the name.
    * `(\d+)` captures one or more digits for the age.
* The extracted data is returned as a DataFrame, where each capturing group becomes a column.
* `extracted_data.columns = ['Name', 'Age']` assigns column names 'Name' and 'Age' to the extracted data DataFrame for better readability and usability.

### üßΩ pandas Data Cleaning - String Operations and Typos Correction ‚úçÔ∏è

**Cleaning and Standardizing Text Data in pandas**

Let's explore techniques for detecting and correcting typographical errors.

::left::

**5. Typos Correction:**

* Typos are common in text data and can lead to inconsistencies and errors in analysis.
* Techniques for detecting and correcting typos include:
    * **Fuzzy Matching:** Using algorithms to measure the similarity between strings and identify potential typos.
    * **Dictionary Lookup:** Comparing words to a predefined dictionary to identify and correct misspelled words.

::right::

**Fuzzy Matching in Detail:**

* Fuzzy matching algorithms calculate the "distance" between two strings.
* This distance represents how many changes (insertions, deletions, substitutions) are needed to transform one string into another.
* Common algorithms include:
    * **Levenshtein Distance:** Measures the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other.

    if score >= threshold:
        return match
    return word

# Define a correct word list
correct_words = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Correct typos in the Series
corrected_data = data.apply(lambda x: correct_typo(x, correct_words))

Let's explore techniques for detecting and correcting typographical errors.


**Output & Explanation (Slide 10.2 & 10.3):**
```bash
Original Series:
0      apple
1       aple
2     banana
3    bananna
4     orange
5      ornge
dtype: object

Corrected Series:
0     apple
1     apple
2    banana
3    banana
4    orange
5    orange
dtype: object
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* The code uses the `fuzzywuzzy` library for fuzzy matching.
* The `correct_typo` function takes a word, a list of correct words, and a threshold as input.
* It uses `process.extractOne` to find the closest match in the word list based on the `fuzz.token_sort_ratio` score.
* If the score is above the threshold (80 in this case), the function returns the matched correct word; otherwise, it returns the original word.
* The `apply` method is used to apply the `correct_typo` function to each word in the Series, correcting any typos.
