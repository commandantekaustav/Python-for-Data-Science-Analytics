**Essential NumPy Array Operations and Concepts**

Let's start by understanding how to create NumPy arrays.

::left::

**1. Creating NumPy Arrays:**

* NumPy arrays can be created from lists, tuples, or other array-like objects.
* The `np.array()` function is used to create arrays.

::right::

**Example: Creating NumPy Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array from a list
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("1D Array:\n", arr1)

# Create a 2D array from a list of lists
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("\n2D Array:\n", arr2)
```

**Essential NumPy Array Operations and Concepts**

Let's see the output of creating NumPy arrays.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 2):**
```bash
1D Array:
 [1 2 3 4 5]

2D Array:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` creates a 1D NumPy array from the given list.
* `np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])` creates a 2D NumPy array from the list of lists.
* NumPy arrays are efficient for numerical operations and data manipulation.

**Essential NumPy Array Operations and Concepts**

Let's explore array indexing and slicing.

::left::

**2. Array Indexing and Slicing:**

* You can access array elements using indexing and slicing, similar to Python lists.
* NumPy arrays support multidimensional indexing.

::right::

**Example: Array Indexing and Slicing**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print("Original Array:\n", arr)

# Accessing elements
print("\nElement at [0, 0]:", arr[0, 0])
print("Element at [1, 2]:", arr[1, 2])

# Slicing
print("\nFirst row:", arr[0, :])
print("First column:", arr[:, 0])
```

### ðŸ”¢ Introduction to NumPy for pandas Users ðŸš€

**Essential NumPy Array Operations and Concepts**

Let's see the output of array indexing and slicing.

::left::

**Output & Explanation (Slide 4):**
```bash
Original Array:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

Element at [0, 0]: 1
Element at [1, 2]: 6

First row: [1 2 3]
First column: [1 4 7]
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `arr[0, 0]` accesses the element at the first row and first column.
* `arr[1, 2]` accesses the element at the second row and third column.
* `arr[0, :]` slices the first row of the array.
* `arr[:, 0]` slices the first column of the array.
* NumPy indexing and slicing are powerful tools for accessing and manipulating array elements.

**Essential NumPy Array Operations and Concepts**

Let's explore array operations.

::left::

**3. Array Operations:**

* NumPy arrays support element-wise mathematical operations.
* You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arrays.

::right::

**Example: Array Operations**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
print("Addition:", arr1 + arr2)

# Element-wise multiplication
print("Multiplication:", arr1 * arr2)

# Scalar multiplication
print("Scalar Multiplication:", arr1 * 2)
```

**Output & Explanation (Slide 6):**
```bash
Addition: [5 7 9]
Multiplication: [ 4 10 18]
Scalar Multiplication: [2 4 6]
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `arr1 + arr2` performs element-wise addition of the two arrays.
* `arr1 * arr2` performs element-wise multiplication of the two arrays.
* `arr1 * 2` multiplies each element of `arr1` by 2.
* NumPy array operations are efficient and perform element-wise operations by default.

### ðŸ”¢ Introduction to NumPy for pandas Users ðŸš€

**Essential NumPy Array Operations and Concepts**

Let's explore vectorization.

::left::

**4. Vectorization:**

* Vectorization is the process of applying operations to entire arrays instead of individual elements.
* It significantly speeds up numerical computations.
* NumPy operations are vectorized by default.

::right::

**Example: Vectorization**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Vectorized operation
squared_arr = arr ** 2
print("Squared Array:", squared_arr)

# Using NumPy functions
sqrt_arr = np.sqrt(arr)
print("Square Root Array:", sqrt_arr)
```

**Output & Explanation (Slide 8):**
```bash
Squared Array: [ 1  4  9 16 25]
Square Root Array: [1.         1.41421356 1.73205081 2.         2.23606798]
```

::right::

**Explanation:**

* `arr ** 2` squares each element of the array without using explicit loops.
* `np.sqrt(arr)` calculates the square root of each element using the NumPy `sqrt` function.
* Vectorization makes NumPy operations much faster than using traditional Python loops.
* Pandas leverages NumPy's vectorization for efficient data manipulation.

**5. Universal Functions (ufuncs):**

* Universal functions are NumPy functions that operate element-wise on arrays.
* They are highly optimized and efficient.
* Examples include `np.sin()`, `np.cos()`, `np.exp()`, and `np.log()`.

::right::

**Example: Universal Functions (ufuncs)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample array
arr = np.array([0, np.pi/2, np.pi])

# Using ufuncs
sin_arr = np.sin(arr)
print("Sine Array:", sin_arr)

exp_arr = np.exp(arr)
print("Exponential Array:", exp_arr)
```
