### Introduction to Conditional Statements (if) 🚦
# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - `if`

**Let's start with the first type of control flow: **Conditional Statements**, specifically the `if` statement.**
::left::
**What are Conditional Statements?**

*   Conditional statements allow your program to **make decisions** and execute different code blocks based on whether a certain **condition** is true or false.
*   The most basic conditional statement is the `if` statement.

::right::

**The `if` Statement Syntax:**

```python
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
```

- `if` **keyword**: Starts the `if` statement.
- `condition`: An expression that is evaluated to either `True` or `False` (a boolean expression).
- **Colon** `:`**:** Marks the end of the `if` condition line. **Don't forget it!**
- **Indented block of code:** The statements indented below the `if` line are executed `only if` the `condition` is `True`. **Indentation is mandatory**

### Introduction to Conditional Statements (if) 🚦
# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - `if`

**Example - Simple `if` Statement:**
```py
age = 20

if age >= 18: # Condition: Is age greater than or equal to 18?
    print("You are an adult.") # This line is executed because the condition is True
```
::left::
**Explanation**:

1. The `if` statement checks the condition `age >= 18`.
2. Since `age` is 20, the condition `20 >= 18` is `True`.
::right::
3. Therefore, the indented code block under the `if` statement ( `print("You are an adult.")` ) is executed.
4. If `age` were, for example, 15, the condition `15 >= 18` would be `False`, and the indented code block would be skipped.

**Next: Let's add more to our conditional statements with `else`!** ➡️

---
layout: two-cols-header
---

### Conditional Statements (if-else) 🚦
# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - `if-else`

**The `if` statement allows you to execute code when a condition is true. But what if you want to execute *different* code when the condition is *false*?  That's where the `else` clause comes in.**
::left::
**The `if-else` Statement Syntax:**

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition = True
    statements_if_true
else:
    # Code to execute if condition = False
    statements_if_false
```
::right::
- `if` **keyword and** `condition`: Same as in the `if` statement.
- `else` **keyword**: Introduces the `else` block. The `else` clause is optional, but when used with `if`, it provides an alternative code path.
- **Colon** `:` **after** `else`: Also mandatory.
- **Indented code block under** `else`: The statements indented under the `else` line are executed **only if** the `if` condition is `False`.
---
layout: two-cols-header
---

### Conditional Statements (if-else) 🚦
# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - `if-else`
::left::
**Example - `if-else` Statement:**
```py
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    # Executed if age >= 18 (True)
    print("You are an adult.") 
else:
    # Executed if age >= 18 (False)
    print("You are a minor.")  
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `if` condition `age >= 18` is checked.
2. Since `age` is 15, the condition `15 >= 18` is `False`.
::right::
3. Therefore, the code block under the `if` is *skipped*, and the code block under the `else` clause ( `print("You are a minor.")` ) is executed.
4. If `age` were 20, the `if` condition would be `True`, the `if` block would execute, and the `else` block would be skipped.

**Key Point:**  In an `if-else` statement, **exactly one** of the two code blocks (either the `if` block or the `else` block) will be executed, depending on whether the condition is true or false.

**Next:  Let's add even more flexibility with `elif` for multiple conditions!** ➡️

---

### Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) 🚦

# Control Flow: `if-elif-else`

**What if you have more than two possibilities?  For example, you want to check multiple conditions in sequence?  Use `elif` (else if)!**

**The `if-elif-else` Statement Syntax:**
```py
if condition1:
    # Code to execute 
    # if condition1 is True
    statements_if_condition1_true
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
    statements_if_condition2_true
elif condition3:
    # Code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
    statements_if_condition3_true
... # You can have zero or more elif clauses
else: # Optional else clause
    # Code to execute if ALL conditions (if and all elifs) are False
    statements_if_all_conditions_false
```
---
layout: two-cols-header
---

### Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) 🚦

# Control Flow: `if-elif-else`
::left::
**The `if-elif-else` Statement Syntax:**

- **`if` keyword and `condition1`:** The initial condition to check.
- **`elif` keyword (short for "else if"):** Allows you to check additional conditions if the preceding if or elif conditions were false. You can have zero or more `elif` clauses.
- **`else` keyword (optional):** Provides a default code block to execute if *none* of the `if` or - `elif` conditions were true.
::right::
**Example - `if-elif-else` Statement:**
```py
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80: # Condition checked only if score < 90
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70: # Condition checked only if score < 80
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60: # Condition checked only if score < 70
    grade = "D"
else: # Executed if none of the above conditions are True (score < 60)
    grade = "F"

print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}") # Output: Score: 75, Grade: C
```
---

### Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) 🚦
# Control Flow: `if-elif-else`
<br>

**Explanation:**

1. Conditions are checked in order: `if`, then the first `elif`, then the second `elif`, and so on.
2. As soon as a condition is found to be `True`, the corresponding code block is executed, and the rest of the `elif` and `else` clauses are skipped.
3. If *none* of the `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`, then the (optional) `else` block is executed.
4. If there is no `else` block and none of the conditions are true, then *no* code block within the `if-elif-else` structure is executed.

**Key Point:** `if-elif-else` allows you to handle multiple mutually exclusive conditions and create more complex decision-making logic in your programs.

**Next: Let's practice writing conditional statements with a "Your Turn" exercise!** ✍️

---

#
# Your Turn!  Conditional Statement Exercise

**Time to practice writing conditional statements!**

**Exercise:  Number Classifier**

**Task:** Write a Python program that does the following:

1.  **Prompt the user to enter an integer number.** (You can use the `input()` function to get input as a string, and then convert it to an integer using `int()`).
2.  **Classify the number** based on these rules:
    *   If the number is **positive** (greater than 0), print "Positive number".
    *   If the number is **negative** (less than 0), print "Negative number".
    *   If the number is **zero**, print "Zero".

**Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to implement this logic.**

---

# Your Turn!  Conditional Statement Exercise

**Time to practice writing conditional statements!**

**Example Interaction:**
```bash
Enter an integer: 15
Positive number

Enter an integer: -7
Negative number

Enter an integer: 0
Zero
```
**Bonus Challenge (Optional):**

- Extend your program to also check if the positive number is even or odd, and print "Positive Even number" or "Positive Odd number" accordingly. (Hint: use the modulo operator `%` to check for even/odd).

**Take a few minutes to complete this exercise.  Then we'll discuss a possible solution!**

**(Session 4: Control Flow - Conditional Statements - Your Turn)**

### Conditional Statements (Nested if) 🚦

# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - Nested `if`

**Conditional statements can be nested inside each other to create more complex decision-making structures.** This means you can put an `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement *within* another `if` or `else` block.

**Nested `if` Statement Example:**

```python
num = 10

if num >= 0: # Outer 'if' condition: Is num non-negative?
    print("Number is non-negative")
    if num == 0: # Nested 'if' condition: Is num equal to 0? (only checked if outer 'if' is True)
        print("Number is zero")
    else: # Nested 'else' clause: (only if outer 'if' is True AND nested 'if' is False)
        print("Number is positive")
else: # Outer 'else' clause: (only if outer 'if' is False - num is negative)
    print("Number is negative")
```
---

### Conditional Statements (Nested if) 🚦

# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - Nested `if`
<br>

**Explanation of Nested `if`:**

1. **Outer `if`:** The program first checks if `num >= 0`. In this case, it's true (10 >= 0).
2. **Outer `if` block executes:** Because the outer `if` condition is true, the code block indented under it is executed. This block *itself* contains another conditional statement.
3. **Nested `if`:** Inside the outer `if` block, the nested `if num == 0` condition is checked. For `num = 10`, this is false (10 is not equal to 0).
4. **Nested `else` executes:** Because the nested `if` condition is false, the nested `else` block is executed, printing "Number is positive".
5. If the outer `if` condition ( `num >= 0` ) had been false (e.g., if `num` was -5), then the outer `else` block would have executed directly, and the nested conditional statement would have been completely skipped.
---

### Conditional Statements (Nested if) 🚦

# Control Flow: Conditional Statements - Nested `if`

**Indentation is Crucial for Nested Conditionals:**

- Indentation clearly shows the nesting level and which `if`, `elif`, or `else` clause each code block belongs to. Incorrect indentation will lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

**Use Nested `if` Statements When:**

- You need to check conditions within conditions.
- You want to create a hierarchy of decisions.
- Be careful not to nest too deeply, as it can make code harder to read. For very complex conditions, consider alternative approaches like using functions or more structured logic.

**Next: Let's move on from conditional statements to another essential control flow structure: Loops!  Starting with for loops.** ➡️

---

### Introduction to `for` Loops 🔄

# Control Flow: Loops - `for` Loops - Iteration

**Now, let's learn about **Loops**, which are essential for automating repetitive tasks in programming. We'll start with **`for` loops**.**

**What are `for` Loops?**

*   `for` loops are used to **iterate** over a **sequence** (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other **iterable** object.
*   They execute a block of code **repeatedly** for each item in the sequence.
*   `for` loops are very useful for processing collections of data, performing actions on each item in a list, and more.
---

### Introduction to `for` Loops 🔄

# Control Flow: Loops - `for` Loops - Iteration

**The `for` Loop Syntax:**

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item in the sequence
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
```

- **`for` keyword:** Starts the `for` loop.
- **`item`:** A variable that will take on the value of each item in the `sequence` during each iteration of the loop. You can choose any valid variable name here.
- **`in` keyword:** Used to specify that you are iterating *in* the given sequence.
- **sequence:** The iterable object you are looping through (e.g., a list, tuple, string, range).
- **Colon `:`:** Marks the end of the `for` loop line.
- **Indented block of code:** The statements indented below the `for` line are executed **once for each item** in the `sequence`.

### Introduction to `for` Loops 🔄

# Control Flow: Loops - `for` Loops - Iteration
::left::
**Example - `for` loop iterating through a list:**
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Loop through each fruit in the 'fruits' list
for fruit in fruits:
    # Print the current 'fruit' in each iteration 
    print(fruit)    

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `for` loop starts iterating through the `fruits` list.
::right::

2. In the **first iteration**, the variable `fruit` is assigned as first item in the list, i.e., "apple". `print(fruit)` is executed, printing "apple".
3. In the **second iteration**, `fruit` is assigned the next item, "banana", and `print(fruit)` prints "banana".
4. In the **third iteration**, `fruit` is assigned "cherry", and "cherry" is printed.
5. After processing all items in the `fruits` list, the loop finishes.

**Next: Let's explore more examples of `for` loops and different sequences you can iterate over!** ➡️

## `for` Loop Examples (Iterating through Sequences) 🔄

# `for` Loop Examples: Iterating Through Sequences

**Let's look at more examples of `for` loops, iterating through different types of sequences.**
::left::
**1. Iterating through a String (Characters):**

```python
message = "Hello"

# Loop through each character in the string 'message'
for char in message: 
    # Print the current character
    print(char)      

# Output:
# H
# e
# l
# l
# o
```
::right::
**2. Iterating through a Tuple:**

```py
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)

# Loop through each item in the 'coordinates' tuple
for coord in coordinates: 
    # Print the current coordinate
    print(coord)         

# Output:
# 10
# 20
# 30
```

## `for` Loop Examples (Iterating through Sequences) 🔄

# `for` Loop Examples: Iterating Through Sequences

**3. Iterating through a `range()` object (Generating number sequences):**

- The `range(start, stop, step)` function is very commonly used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers.

```py
# range(5) generates numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (up to, but not including 5)
for number in range(5): # Loop through numbers generated by range(5)
    print(number)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

**3. Iterating through a `range()` object (Generating number sequences):**

- The `range(start, stop, step)` function is very commonly used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers.

```py
for i in range(2, 7): # range(2, 7) generates numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (from 2 up to, but not including 7)
    print(i)

# Output:
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
```

**3. Iterating through a `range()` object (Generating number sequences):**

- The `range(start, stop, step)` function is very commonly used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers.


```py
for j in range(0, 10, 2): # range(0, 10, 2) generates 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (from 0 up to 10, with a step of 2)
    print(j)

# Output:
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
```
---

## `for` Loop Examples (Iterating through Sequences) 🔄

# `for` Loop Examples: Iterating Through Sequences

**4. for loop with else clause (optional):**
-  A `for` loop can have an optional `else` clause that executes **after the loop finishes *normally*** (i.e., after iterating through all items in the sequence), but **not if the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.**

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
else: # else clause executes after the loop completes normally
    print("Loop finished without break")

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# Loop finished without break
```
---

## `for` Loop Examples (Iterating through Sequences) 🔄

# `for` Loop Examples: Iterating Through Sequences

**Your Turn!**

- In your Jupyter Notebook, experiment with `for` loops:
    - Iterate through different strings and print each character.
    - Iterate through tuples of your choice.
    - Use `range()` to generate number sequences and loop through them.
    - Try using the `else` clause with a `for` loop (we'll see `break` later to understand when `else` is skipped).

**Next: Let's learn about another very common use of `for` loops: Iterating using indices and `enumerate()`!** ➡️

---

### `for` Loop with `enumerate()` (Index and Item) 🔄📍

# `for` Loop with `enumerate()`: Accessing Index and Item

**Often, when you iterate through a sequence, you need not only the *item* itself, but also its *index* (position) in the sequence.**  Python's `enumerate()` function is perfect for this!

**What does `enumerate()` do?**

*   `enumerate(sequence)` is a built-in function that takes a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) as input and returns an **enumerate object**.
*   This enumerate object yields pairs of **(index, item)** for each element in the sequence.
---

### `for` Loop with `enumerate()` (Index and Item) 🔄📍

# `for` Loop with `enumerate()`: Accessing Index and Item

**Using `enumerate()` in a `for` loop:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits): # Enumerate returns index and item in each iteration
    print(f"Index: {index}, Fruit: {fruit}") # Access both index and fruit

# Output:
# Index: 0, Fruit: apple
# Index: 1, Fruit: banana
# Index: 2, Fruit: cherry
```
---

### `for` Loop with `enumerate()` (Index and Item) 🔄📍

# `for` Loop with `enumerate()`: Accessing Index and Item

**Explanation:**

1. `enumerate(fruits)` is called on the `fruits` list.
2. In each iteration of the `for` loop, `enumerate()` yields a pair of values:
    - The **first value** is the **index** of the current item (starting from 0).
    - The **second value** is the **item** itself.
3. We use **tuple unpacking** in the `for` loop header (`for index, fruit in ...`) to assign these two values to the variables `index` and `fruit` respectively in each iteration.
4. Inside the loop, we can now access both the index and the fruit name.
---

### `for` Loop with `enumerate()` (Index and Item) 🔄📍

# `for` Loop with `enumerate()`: Accessing Index and Item

**Starting index for `enumerate()` (optional):**

- By default, `enumerate()` starts indexing from 0.
- You can specify a different starting index using the optional `start` argument: `enumerate(sequence, start=starting_index)`.

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for count, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1): # Start index from 1
    print(f"Position: {count}, Fruit: {fruit}")

# Output:
# Position: 1, Fruit: apple
# Position: 2, Fruit: banana
# Position: 3, Fruit: cherry
```
---

### `for` Loop with `enumerate()` (Index and Item) 🔄📍

# `for` Loop with `enumerate()`: Accessing Index and Item

**Your Turn!**

- Create a list of your favorite programming languages.
- Use a `for` loop with `enumerate()` to iterate through the list and print the index and the language name for each item.
- Try using the `start` argument in `enumerate()` to start the index from 1 or any other number.


**`enumerate()` is a very convenient and Pythonic way to get both indices and items when iterating through sequences in `for` loops!** ✨

**Next: Let's move on to another type of loop: `while` loops, for repeating code based on a condition!** ➡️

---

## Introduction to `while` Loops 🔁

# Control Flow: Loops - `while` Loops - Condition-Based Repetition

**Now let's learn about **`while` loops**, another type of loop in Python that allows you to repeat a block of code based on a **condition**.**

**What are `while` Loops?**

*   `while` loops repeat a block of code **as long as a given condition is `True`**.
*   They are useful when you want to repeat something an **indefinite number of times** until a certain condition is met, rather than iterating through a fixed sequence.
*   The loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true. Once the condition becomes `False`, the loop terminates.
---

## Introduction to `while` Loops 🔁

# Control Flow: Loops - `while` Loops - Condition-Based Repetition

**The `while` Loop Syntax:**

```python
while condition:
    # Code to be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
```

- **`while` keyword:** Starts the `while` loop.
- `condition`: An expression that is evaluated to either `True` or `False`. The loop continues as long as this condition is `True`.
- **Colon `:`:** Marks the end of the `while` condition line.   
- **Indented block of code:** The statements indented below the `while` line are executed repeatedly **as long as the `condition` is `True`.**
---

## Introduction to `while` Loops 🔁

# Control Flow: Loops - `while` Loops - Condition-Based Repetition
::left::
**Example - Simple `while` Loop:**
```py
count = 0

while count < 5: 
    # Condition: Is count less than 5?
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    # Important: Update the loop counter!
    count = count + 1  

# Output:
# Count is: 0
# Count is: 1
# Count is: 2
# Count is: 3
# Count is: 4
```
::right::
**Explanation:**

1. Initially, `count` is 0.
2. The `while` loop checks the condition `count < 5`. It's true (0 < 5).
3. The code block inside the loop executes: `print(f"Count is: {count}")` prints "Count is: 0", and then `count = count + 1` increments `count` to 1.

## Introduction to `while` Loops 🔁

# Control Flow: Loops - `while` Loops - Condition-Based Repetition
::left::
**Example - Simple `while` Loop:**
```py
count = 0

while count < 5: 
    # Condition: Is count less than 5?
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    # Important: Update the loop counter!
    count = count + 1  

# Output:
# Count is: 0
# Count is: 1
# Count is: 2
# Count is: 3
# Count is: 4
```
::right::
**Explanation:**

4. The loop goes back to the condition check. Now `count` is 1. `1 < 5` is still true.
5. Steps 2-4 repeat until `count` becomes 5.
6. When `count` is 5, the condition `count < 5` becomes `False`.
7. The `while` loop terminates, and the program continues execution after the loop.
---

**Important: Loop Condition and Termination:**

- It's crucial to ensure that the condition in a `while` loop will eventually become `False` so that the loop terminates.
- If the condition *always* remains `True`, you will create an **infinite loop**, which will run forever (or until you manually stop the program). Be careful to design your `while` loop conditions correctly to avoid infinite loops!

**Next: Let's see more examples of `while` loops and learn how to control loop execution more precisely!** ➡️

### `while` Loop Examples & `else` Clause 🔁🚦
# `while` Loop Examples and the `else` Clause

**Let's explore more examples of `while` loops and learn about the optional `else` clause for `while` loops.**
::left::
**1. `while` loop with user input:**

```python
user_input = "" # Initialize user_input

while user_input != "quit": # Loop as long as user input is NOT "quit"
    user_input = input("Enter a command (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")

print("Exiting program.") # Executed after the loop terminates
```

**Explanation:**

- This loop keeps asking the user for input until they type "quit".
- The `while` condition `user_input != "quit"` checks if the input is not equal to "quit".
::right::
- Inside the loop, we get user input and print it back.
- When the user enters "quit", the condition becomes `False`, and the loop ends.

### `while` Loop Examples & `else` Clause 🔁🚦
# `while` Loop Examples and the `else` Clause
::left::
2. **`while` loop with a boolean flag:**

```py
# Initialize a boolean flag
is_running = True 
while is_running:
    print("Program is running...")
    command = input("Enter 'stop' to stop: ")
    if command == "stop":
        # Set flag to False to stop the loop
        is_running = False 

# Executed after the loop terminates
print("Program stopped.") 
```

**Explanation:**

- This example uses a boolean variable `is_running` to control the loop.
::right::
- The loop continues as long as `is_running` is `True`.
- Inside the loop, we check for user input "stop". If entered, we set `is_running` to `False`, which will terminate the loop in the next condition check.
---

### `while` Loop Examples & `else` Clause 🔁🚦
# `while` Loop Examples and the `else` Clause

3. **`while` loop with `else` clause (optional):**

- Just like `for` loops, `while` loops can also have an optional `else` clause.
- The `else` block in a `while` loop executes when the loop condition becomes `False` and the loop terminates **normally** (without being interrupted by a `break` statement).

```py
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"Count in loop: {count}")
    count += 1
else: # else clause executes when the while condition becomes False
    print("While loop condition became False. Else block executed.")

# Output:
# Count in loop: 0

**Important: Infinite Loops (and how to avoid them):**

- Be very careful when writing `while` loop conditions. If the condition never becomes `False`, you'll create an **infinite loop**.
- Always ensure that something within the loop body will eventually make the `while` condition `False` to prevent infinite loops.

# `while` Loop Examples and the `else` Clause

**Your Turn!**

- Experiment with `while` loops in your Jupyter Notebook:
    - Write a `while` loop that asks the user for numbers and stops when they enter a specific value (like 0 or -1).
    - Create a `while` loop controlled by a boolean flag.
    - Try adding an `else` clause to a `while` loop and observe when it executes.
    - Intentionally create an infinite loop (e.g., `while True: print("Looping forever")`) and learn how to interrupt it (usually by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or interrupting the kernel in Jupyter).

**Next: Let's learn about `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution flow more precisely!** ➡️

## Loop Control: `break` and `continue` 🛠️
# Loop Control Statements: `break` and `continue`

**Python provides special statements `break` and `continue` to give you more fine-grained control over the execution flow of loops (`for` and `while` loops).**

**1. `break` Statement: Exiting a Loop Prematurely**

*   The `break` statement is used to **immediately exit** out of the current loop (both `for` and `while` loops).
*   When `break` is encountered, the loop terminates, and the program execution continues with the statement immediately after the loop.
*   If a loop has an `else` clause, the `else` block is **not executed** if the loop is terminated by `break`.

for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        break # Exit the loop when num is 3
    print(num)
else: # else clause is skipped because loop was broken
    print("Else block - loop finished normally") # This line will NOT be printed

print("Loop ended.") # This line will be printed after the loop (due to break)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# Loop ended.
```

**2. `continue` Statement: Skipping to the Next Iteration**

*   The `continue` statement is used to **skip the rest of the current iteration** of the loop and move on to the **next iteration**.
*   The loop does *not* terminate when `continue` is encountered. It simply jumps to the beginning of the next iteration.

        continue # Skip to the next iteration when num is 3 - rest of current iteration is skipped
    print(num) # This line is skipped when num is 3
else:
    print("Else block - loop finished normally") # Else block IS executed as loop finished fully
print("Loop ended.") # This line is printed after the loop
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5
# Else block - loop finished normally
# Loop ended.

# Loop Control Statements: `break` and `continue`

**Python provides special statements `break` and `continue` to give you more fine-grained control over the execution flow of loops (`for` and `while` loops).**

**Key Differences between `break` and `continue`:**

*   `break`: **Exits the loop completely.**
*   `continue`: **Skips the rest of the *current* iteration and continues with the next iteration.**

**When to use `break` and `continue`:**

*   `break`: Use when you need to exit a loop early based on a certain condition (e.g., found a solution, encountered an error, user wants to quit).
*   `continue`: Use when you want to skip processing the current item in a loop and move to the next one (e.g., skip invalid data, handle specific cases differently).

# Loop Control Statements: `break` and `continue`

**Your Turn!**

*   Experiment with `break` and `continue` in both `for` and `while` loops in your Jupyter Notebook.
*   Modify your "Number Classifier" program to use a loop that keeps asking for numbers until the user enters "quit" (use `while` loop and `break`).
*   Create a loop that iterates through a list of numbers and uses `continue` to skip even numbers and only process/print odd numbers.

**`break` and `continue` are powerful tools for controlling the flow within loops and making your loop logic more flexible and efficient!** ✨

## Session 4 Summary - Control Flow ✅

# Session 4 Wrap-up:  Controlling the Flow of Your Code

**Congratulations on completing Session 4: "Control Flow - Logic in Your Code"!** 🎉

**Let's quickly summarize the key control flow concepts we've covered in this session:**

*   **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):**  Learned how to make decisions in your code, execute different code paths based on conditions (True/False). 🚦
*   **`for` Loops:** Mastered iterating over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, ranges) and other iterables to repeat actions for each item. 🔄
*   **`while` Loops:**  Understood how to repeat code blocks based on a condition, for indefinite repetition until a condition is met. 🔁
*   **Loop Control Statements (`break`, `continue`):**  Learned to control loop execution flow: `break` to exit loops early, `continue` to skip to the next iteration. 🛠️
*   **Nested Conditionals and Loops:**  Explored how to nest control flow structures for more complex logic.
