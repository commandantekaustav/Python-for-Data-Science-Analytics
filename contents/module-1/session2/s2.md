*   **Community Standard:**  Most Python projects and libraries follow PEP 8.  It's the **accepted norm** in the Python ecosystem. 🌍

**In short: PEP 8 makes you a more effective and respected Python developer!** 🚀

<!-- **Let's dive into some specific PEP 8 guidelines in the following slides.** -->
---


## PEP 8: Indentation 📏

# PEP 8 Guideline: Indentation

**Indentation is *critical* in Python. It's not just for style - it's part of the syntax!**

PEP 8 has specific recommendations for indentation to ensure consistency and readability.

**PEP 8 Indentation Rules:**

*   **Use 4 spaces per indentation level.**  This is the *standard* in Python.
    *   **DO NOT USE tabs for indentation.** Mixes of tabs and spaces can cause subtle errors and display inconsistently. Configure your editor to insert spaces when you press the Tab key.
*   **Use indentation to clearly structure your code blocks:**  Indentation visually groups lines of code that belong together (e.g., inside a function, loop, or conditional statement).
---

## PEP 8: Indentation 📏

<!-- # PEP 8 Guideline: Indentation -->

**Example (Correct PEP 8 Indentation):**

```python
def my_function(argument1, argument2): # Function definition
    if argument1 > 10:             # Indented 'if' block
        print("Argument 1 is greater than 10") # Indented statement inside 'if'
        result = argument1 * argument2      # Still inside 'if'
        return result                     # Still inside 'if', returns value
    else:                                # 'else' aligned with 'if'
        print("Argument 1 is not greater than 10") # Indented 'else' block
        return 0                          # Indented statement inside 'else'
result_value = my_function(15, 5)      # Back to no indentation (main code flow)
print(result_value)                   # No indentation
```

**Example (Incorrect Indentation - Violates PEP 8 and can cause errors!):**
```py
def incorrect_indentation_func():
 if True: # Incorrect: Only 1 space indentation
  print("This is incorrectly indented") # Incorrect: Only 2 spaces
 return  # Incorrect: Only 1 space, inconsistent with 'if' block
```

**Key Takeaway:**  Consistent 4-space indentation is essential for readable and correct Python code.  Configure your editor to help you with this!

**Next:  Let's look at another important PEP 8 aspect: Line Length! ➡️**
---

## PEP 8: Line Length ↔️

# PEP 8 Guideline: Line Length

**Keeping lines of code to a reasonable length is crucial for readability, especially on different screen sizes and when collaborating.**

PEP 8 recommends a maximum line length to enhance code readability.

**PEP 8 Line Length Rules:**

<v-clicks depth="2">

*   **Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.**
    *   This is a **strong recommendation** for maximum readability.
    *   Historically based on terminal widths, but still relevant for code reviews and side-by-side code display.
*   **For comments and docstrings, limit lines to 72 characters.**
    *   Slightly shorter limit for comments to allow for better visual separation.
</v-clicks>

--- 

## PEP 8: Line Length ↔️

# PEP 8 Guideline: Line Length

**Keeping lines of code to a reasonable length is crucial for readability, especially on different screen sizes and when collaborating.**

**Why Line Length Limits?**

<v-clicks>

*   **Improved Readability:**  Long lines can be hard to read, requiring horizontal scrolling or wrapping, which disrupts code flow. Shorter lines are easier to scan and understand. 👓
*   **Easier Side-by-Side Code Review:**  When reviewing code changes in diffs or on platforms like GitHub, shorter lines fit better side-by-side, making reviews more efficient. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
*   **Better for Different Screen Sizes:**  Code is viewed on various screen sizes. Limiting line length ensures readability even on smaller screens or split editor windows. 💻

</v-clicks>
---

## PEP 8: Line Length ↔️
<br>

**Example (Line too long - Violates PEP 8):**

```python
# Line is excessively long and goes beyond 79 characters, making it harder to read on smaller screens or side-by-side:
very_long_variable_name_for_example = calculate_something_complex(parameter_one, parameter_two, parameter_three, parameter_four)
```

**Example (Line within PEP 8 limit - More Readable):**
```py
# Break long lines for readability, use parentheses for continuation if needed:
very_long_variable = calculate_something_complex(
    parameter_one,
    parameter_two,
    parameter_three,
    parameter_four,
)
```

**Key Takeaway:**  Be mindful of line length. Break long lines to improve readability, especially for complex expressions or function calls with many arguments. Most editors have features to fix line length limits.

**Next:  Let's explore PEP 8 guidelines for Blank Lines and Whitespace! ➡️**
---

## PEP 8: Blank Lines & Whitespace 💨

# PEP 8 Guideline: Blank Lines and Whitespace

**Blank lines and whitespace (spaces around operators, etc.) might seem minor, but they significantly impact code readability.**  PEP 8 provides guidelines for their effective use.

**PEP 8 Blank Line Rules:**

<v-clicks depth="2">

*   **Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.**  This visually separates major code blocks.
*   **Separate method definitions inside a class with one blank line.**  Organizes methods within a class.
*   **Use blank lines sparingly within functions** to separate logical sections of code, but avoid excessive blank lines that make code too sparse.
</v-clicks>
---
layout: two-cols-header
---

## PEP 8: Blank Lines & Whitespace 💨
<!-- **PEP 8 Whitespace Rules (Around Operators, etc.):** -->

::left::

<v-clicks depth="2">

*   **Surround binary operators (e.g., `+, -, *, /, ==, >, <, =, +=`) with a single space on either side.**  Improves visual clarity.
    *   **Correct:** `x = a + b` , `if x == 5:`
    *   **Incorrect:** `x=a+b`, `if x==5:`
*   **No whitespace immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.**
    *   **Correct:** `function_call(argument1, argument2)`, `my_list[index]`
    *   **Incorrect:** `function_call( argument1, argument2 )`, `my_list[ index ]`
</v-clicks>
::right::

<v-clicks depth="2">

*   **No whitespace before a comma, semicolon, or colon.**
    *   **Correct:** `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `for i in range(10):`
    *   **Incorrect:** `my_list = [1 , 2 , 3]`, `for i in range( 10 ) :`
*   **Function arguments: No space around the `=` sign when used for keyword arguments or default parameter values.**
    *   **Correct:** `function_call(argument1=value1)`, `def my_function(param1=None):`
    *   **Incorrect:** `function_call(argument1 = value1)`, `def my_function(param1 = None):`

</v-clicks>
---

**Example (Correct use of Blank Lines and Whitespace):**

```python
def calculate_area(length, width): # Function definition - two blank lines before (if top-level)
    area = length * width  # Space around '*' operator
    return area


class Rectangle:          # Class definition - two blank lines before (if top-level)
    def __init__(self, l, w): # Method definition - one blank line before
        self.length = l
        self.width = w

    def get_area(self):      # Method definition - one blank line before
        return calculate_area(self.length, self.width) # Function call, spaces inside parentheses
```

**Key Takeaway:** Consistent use of blank lines and whitespace makes code visually organized and easier to read. Pay attention to these details!

**Next: We'll move on to PEP 8 Naming Conventions! ➡️**

---
layout: two-cols-header
---

### PEP 8: Naming Conventions 🏷️
# PEP 8 Guideline: Naming Conventions

**Choosing good names improves is extremely important for code readability and understanding.** PEP 8 provides clear and consistent naming conventions.
::left::
*   **Variables:**
    *   Use **lowercase with words separated by underscores** (snake_case).
    *   Examples: `user_name`, `total_count`, `item_price`
*   **Functions:**
    *   Use **lowercase with words separated by underscores** (snake_case).
    *   Examples: `calculate_total()`, `process_data()`, `get_user_input()`
::right::
*   **Classes:**
    *   Use **CapWords (CamelCase)** - capitalize the first letter of each word.
    *   Examples: `ShoppingCart`, `DataProcessor`, `UserProfile`
*   **Modules and Packages:**
    *   Use **short, lowercase names**.  Underscores can be used if it improves readability.
    *   Examples: `utils.py`, `data_helpers.py`, `my_package/`

---
layout: two-cols-header
---

### PEP 8: Naming Conventions 🏷️
::left::
*   **Constants:**
    *   Use **all uppercase with words separated by underscores**.
    *   Examples: `MAX_USERS`, `API_KEY`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`

**Why Consistent Naming?**

*   **Predictability:**  When you see a name, you can quickly guess what type of thing it refers to (variable, function, class, etc.).
*   **Readability:** Consistent naming conventions are a visual cue that helps readers quickly understand the structure and elements of the code. 👓

::right:: 
*   **Reduces Cognitive Load:** You don't have to constantly guess what a name means or what type of entity it is.

**Example (PEP 8 Compliant Naming):**

```python
MAX_VALUE = 100  # Constant

def calculate_average(data_list): # Function
    total_sum = sum(data_list) # Variable
    average_value = total_sum / len(data_list)
    return average_value

class DataAnalyzer: # Class
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def process_and_analyze(self): # Method (function inside a class)
        # ... analysis logic ...
        pass
```

<br>

**Key Takeaway:** Follow PEP 8 naming conventions consistently. It significantly enhances the readability and professionalism of your Python code!

**Next: Let's move to PEP 8 guidelines on Comments and Docstrings!** ➡️

---

## PEP 8: Comments and Docstrings 💬

# PEP 8 Guideline: Comments and Docstrings

**Good comments and documentation are essential for explaining your code and making it understandable to others (and your future self!).** PEP 8 provides guidelines for writing effective comments and docstrings.

**PEP 8 Comment Rules:**

*   **Comments should be concise and explain the *why* and *how*, not just the *what* (which should be obvious from the code itself).**
*   **Comments should be kept up-to-date** with the code.  Outdated comments are worse than no comments!
*   **Use inline comments sparingly** - mainly for explaining complex logic or non-obvious parts of the code.
*   **Block comments** (multiline comments using `#` at the start of each line) are used to describe larger sections of code, functions, classes, or modules.
*   **Start comments with a `#` and a single space.**
---

## PEP 8: Comments and Docstrings 💬

# PEP 8 Guideline: Comments and Docstrings

**PEP 8 Docstring Rules (for Functions, Classes, Modules):**

*   **Docstrings are used to document functions, classes, modules, and methods.** They are multiline strings enclosed in triple quotes (`"""Docstring goes here"""`) and are used for more formal documentation.
*   **Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.**
*   **For functions and methods, docstrings should describe:**
    *   What the function/method does.
    *   What arguments it takes and their types/purposes.
    *   What it returns (if anything) and the return type.
    *   Any exceptions it might raise.
*   **For classes, docstrings should describe the class's purpose and main attributes/methods.**
*   **The *first line* of a docstring should be a concise summary of the object's purpose.**
---

## PEP 8: Comments and Docstrings 💬
<!-- # PEP 8 Guideline: Comments and Docstrings -->

**Example (with Comments and Docstrings):**

```python
def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
    """
    Calculates the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length: The length of the rectangle (numeric).
        width: The width of the rectangle (numeric).

    Returns:
        The area of the rectangle (numeric).
    """
    # Calculate area using formula: area = length * width
    area = length * width
    return area
```

**Key Takeaway:**  Use comments to explain non-obvious parts of your code, and use docstrings to provide comprehensive documentation for functions, classes, and modules.  Good documentation is crucial for maintainability and collaboration!

**Next: Let's talk about tools to help you automatically check and format your code to follow PEP 8!** 🛠️

## Automated PEP 8 Checks with Linters 🛠️

# Automate PEP 8 Checks: Linters to the Rescue!

**Manually checking every line of code against PEP 8 guidelines can be tedious and error-prone.  Fortunately, we have tools to automate this!**
::left::
**Linters: Code Style Checkers**

*   **Linters are tools that analyze your code and automatically check for style violations** (and often, potential errors too!).
*   They **help you catch PEP 8 issues** (like incorrect indentation, line length, naming conventions) **automatically.**
*   Linters **save you time and effort** by quickly identifying style problems.
*   They **promote consistency** across your codebase.
::right::
*   **Popular Python linters:**
    *   **`flake8`:** A widely used and comprehensive linter that combines PEP 8 checks with other style and error detection.
    *   **`pylint`:** Another popular linter, very thorough and customizable.
    *   **VS Code's built-in Python linting:** VS Code, with the Python extension, has built-in linting capabilities (often using `flake8` or `pylint` under the hood).
---

## PEP 8: Comments and Docstrings 💬

# PEP 8 Guideline: Comments and Docstrings

**How to use a linter (example with VS Code):**

*   **If you have the Python extension installed in VS Code, linting is often enabled by default!**
*   **VS Code will often show warnings or underlines** in your code editor if it detects PEP 8 violations or potential errors.
*   **You can usually see detailed linting messages in the "Problems" panel in VS Code** (View > Problems, or `Ctrl+Shift+M` / `Cmd+Shift+M`).

**Example: VS Code showing a PEP 8 warning (e.g., line too long):**

*(Include a screenshot here if possible, showing VS Code with a PEP 8 warning underline or in the Problems panel)*

**Key Takeaway:** Use linters to automatically check your code for PEP 8 violations and style issues. It's a crucial part of writing clean and professional Python code!

**Next: Let's explore automatic code formatting with "Black"!** ✨

# Manual vs. Automated PEP 8 - Let Black Do the Work!

**We just practiced manually identifying and fixing PEP 8 violations.  That's good for learning!**

**However, in real-world development, you won't (and shouldn't!) manually format all your code.**

**Manual Formatting (What We Just Did):**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Good for learning PEP 8 guidelines and understanding style rules.
    *   Forces you to pay attention to code style details.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Time-consuming and tedious,** especially for larger projects.
    *   **Error-prone:**  Easy to miss violations or make mistakes.
    *   **Inconsistent:**  Manual formatting can vary slightly between developers, even with guidelines.
    *   **Not scalable:**  Impractical for large teams and codebases.

**Steps to Format Code with Black in VS Code:**

1.  **Open the `calculate_area.py` file** (or any Python file with unformatted code) in VS Code.
2.  **Right-click anywhere in the code editor.**
3.  **Select "Format Document With..." from the context menu.**
4.  **Choose "Black"** from the list of formatters.  (If "Black" is not listed, make sure you have installed the Black extension and that it's correctly recognized by VS Code).

**Watch Black work its magic!** ✨

*   **Black will instantly reformat your entire code file.**
*   **Indentation will be corrected.**
*   **Line lengths will be adjusted.**
*   **Whitespace will be standardized.**
*   **Naming (if it deviated significantly from conventions) might be flagged (but Black primarily focuses on formatting, not renaming).**

## Manual vs. Automated Formatting - Hello Black! 👋
# Manual vs. Automated PEP 8 - Let Black Do the Work!

**See the "Before" and "After" (Black formatted) code - Observe the changes!**

Self Note: *(show a side-by-side "Before" and "After" code snippet here, or use a code diff view to visually highlight the changes Black makes.)*

**After formatting with Black, your code will automatically adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines, with minimal effort from you!**

**Key Takeaway:**  Make Black your friend!  Use it regularly to format your Python code. It will save you time, improve consistency, and help you write cleaner, more professional code.
