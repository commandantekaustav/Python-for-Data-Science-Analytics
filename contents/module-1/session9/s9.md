## From Exploration to Deployment - Writing Real Python Programs
From _Notebook Snippets_ to _Standalone Scripts_
---

# Pro python Scripting with Version COntrol

<!-- **Points:** -->
  * You already know the basics of Python – control flow, functions, OOP.Now, we're moving beyond simple snippets in notebooks.
  * This segment is focused on building **standalone Python scripts** – `.py` files that you can run directly from the command line, automate tasks with, and deploy as real-world solutions.
  * We will start with code snippets\! and eventually learn to structure, organize, and package our Python code like professionals do.
  * Get ready to write Python that is not just functional, but also *deployable*, *maintainable*, and *collaborative*.

## Tools That Empower Professional Python Scripting
Why These Tools? - The Pro Workflow Advantage

  * **Google Colab:**
    * Low barrier to entry - runs in the browser, no local setup initially needed.
    * Excellent for interactive learning and sharing code snippets, especially in a classroom setting.
    * Cloud-based execution - run scripts from anywhere, useful for demos and quick tests.
    * *However, for serious, deployable scripts, we need more control and local development environments – that's where VS Code comes in.*

## Let's Start in Colab - Your Initial Collaborative Playground
Hands-on with Colab - Your First Python Script Together

### Instructions:

  1. Open your web browser and go to [colab.research.google.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://colab.research.google.com/).
  2. Create a new Python 3 notebook (File -\> New notebook).
  3. Rename your notebook (e.g., 'Module1\_Collaborative\_Scripting').
  4. Share your Colab notebook with your instructor and classmates (Share button).
  5. In the first code cell, type:

```python {1|2|3|all}
  print("Hello, Collaborative Python World from Colab!")
  student_name = input("What is your name? ")
  print(f"Welcome to pro-level scripting, {student_name}!")
```

_Run the cell (`Shift`+`Enter` or `click play button`). See your script execute!_

-----

## Colab - Initial Git Integration: Create a GitHub Repository
Connect Colab to GitHub - Version Control from the Cloud

### Instructions:

  1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a GitHub account (if needed).
  2. Create a new repository on GitHub (`Click` '+' -\> `New repository`).
  3. **Repository Name:**  e.g., `pro-python-scripting-tutorial` or `python-scripting-projects`.
  4. Make it Public (for sharing).
  5. Optionally add a README.
  6. Click 'Create repository'.
  7. Copy the repository URL from your browser.
-----

## Colab - Git Integration: Clone Your GitHub Repo in Colab
Clone GitHub Repository into Colab - Bring Version Control to Your Notebook

* **Instructions (Code cell in Colab):**
  * Create a *new code cell* in Colab (below your 'Hello' script cell).
  * Type and run the following code in the new cell (replace UR_GH_UNAME/UR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name)

```python
import os

repo_url = "https://github.com/UR_GH_UNAME/UR_REPO_NAME.git"
repo_name = "pro-python-scripts"

if not os.path.isdir(repo_name):  # Check if repo already cloned
    !git clone $repo_url  # Clone the repo using git command in Colab shell
os.chdir(repo_name)  # Change directory to the cloned repo
print(f"Cloned repository and changed directory to: {repo_name}")
```

##### Run this cell (`Shift+Enter`). Colab will clone your _empty GitHub repository_ into _its cloud environment_.
##### You'll see output indicating that the repository is cloned.

##### **Explanation:** We are using `!git clone` to run Git commands directly in the Colab notebook environment. `os.chdir changes` the _current working directory_ in Colab.

-----

## Colab - Git Integration: Create a Python Script File in Colab
Create Your First Standalone Script - Even in Colab\!

```python
script_content = """
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name} from a standalone Python script!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
    greet(user_name)
"""
script_filename = "hello_script.py"

with open(script_filename, "w") as f:
    f.write(script_content)
print(f"Created Python script file: {script_filename}")
```

##### Run this cell. This Python code creates a new file named hello_script.py in your Colab environment and writes the Python code defined in script_content into it.

##### **Explanation:** We are programmatically creating a `.py` file and writing Python code to it. This is how we start moving towards standalone scripts, even when working in Colab.

-----

## Colab - Git Integration: Run Your Standalone Script in Colab
Execute Your `.py` Script - From the Colab Terminal

**Instructions (Code cell in Colab):**

  * Create *one more new code cell* in Colab.
  * Type and run:

```py
!python hello_script.py
```
Run this cell. Your hello_script.py script will execute.

##### **Explanation:** `!python hello_script.py` runs the script from Colab shell, like a terminal.

## Colab - Git Integration: Stage, Commit, and Push to GitHub - First Commit!
Version Control in Action - Saving Your Script to GitHub

**Instructions (Code cells in Colab):**
  * Create *three new code cells* in Colab.
  * **Cell 1: Check Git Status**

```python
!git status
```

**Run**. See `untracked file` message for `hello_script.py`.
> **"untracked"**: *Git doesn't know about this new file yet*).


---

## Colab - Git Integration: Stage, Commit, and Push to GitHub - First Commit!
Version Control in Action - Saving Your Script to GitHub
* **Cell 2: Stage the new script**
```python
!git add hello_script.py
```

**Run** this cell. This stages `hello_script.py`. 
>*Tells Git you want to include this file in your next commit*.

---

## Colab - Git Integration: Stage, Commit, and Push to GitHub - First Commit!
Version Control in Action - Saving Your Script to GitHub

* **Cell 3: Commit and Push to GitHub**
```py
!git commit -m "feat: Add initial hello_script.py in Colab" # Good commit message
!git push origin main # or git push origin master, depending on your repo setup
```

Run this cell. This commits your staged changes (*saves them to your local Git repository history*) and then ***pushes** the **commit*** to your ***remote** GitHub repository*.

> You might be prompted to configure your Git username and email in Colab for the first time – follow the instructions if prompted (using git config --global user.name ... and git config --global user.email ...).

> - Go to your **GitHub repository** in your web browser and **refresh** the page. 
> - You should now see `hello_script.py` file in your repository, along with your `commit message`!

## Moving to VS Code : Your Local Powerhouse for Scripting
Stepping into VS Code - Your Professional Code Editor

## But... why?!!

  * Colab is great for starting and sharing. But **for robust, deployable scripts, we need VS Code.**
  * VS Code gives you much **more control, advanced features, and Git integration**.

## Let's set up your local development environment in VS Code.

### **Python Extension Benefits:**
  1. IntelliSense (code completion)
  2. Linting (PEP 8 checking)
  3. Formatting (auto-format to PEP 8)
  4. Debugging (step-through debugging)
  5. Integrated Terminal
  6. Git Integration

and much more\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

-----

## VS Code Setup - Open Your Project Folder (Cloned from GitHub)
Open Your GitHub Repository Folder in your Local device

**Instructions:**
1.  Open VS Code.
2. Go to File -\> Open Folder...
3. Navigate to the local directory on your computer where you cloned your GitHub repository in the previous Colab steps.
> ###### Note: If you cloned it in Colab's default location, you might need to download it from Colab to your local machine first, but ideally, we would have cloned it directly locally if possible – revise Colab instructions if needed to make local cloning clearer earlier on, or adjust this step.
4. Select your repository folder (e.g., `pro-python-scripts`) and click 'Open'.
5. VS Code will open your project folder. You should see your `hello_script.py` file in the Explorer pane (left sidebar).
-----

## VS Code - Local Virtual Environment (VS Code Terminal)
Project Isolation in VS Code

**Instructions:**
1.  Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code (Terminal -> New Terminal or Ctrl+` or Cmd+`).
2. Ensure your terminal is in your project directory (you should see your project folder name in the prompt).
3. Create a virtual environment named venv using the command:

```bash
python -m venv venv  # Or python3 -m venv venv if 'python' defaults to Python 2
```
VS Code will likely detect the new virtual environment and ask if you want to use it for this workspace – click 'Yes' or 'Select Python Interpreter' and choose the Python interpreter inside your venv directory.
-----

## VS Code - Local Virtual Environment (VS Code Terminal)
Project Isolation in VS Code

### Activate the virtual environment in your VS Code terminal:"

 * **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

 * **Windows (PowerShell):** `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

 * **Windows (Command Prompt):** `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`


Your VS Code terminal prompt should now indicate that the venv virtual environment is active.

-----

## VS Code - Run Your Script Locally - 
Execute hello_script.py Locally from VS Code Terminal

**Instructions:**

* In your VS Code terminal (with the virtual environment activated), navigate to your project directory if you're not already there (using cd commands if needed).
* Run your hello_script.py script using:

```bash

python hello_script.py
```
You should see the same output as when you ran it in Colab, but now it's running locally on your machine, within your isolated virtual environment, using VS Code!

-----

## VS Code - Git Integration - Version Control Made Easy
VS Code - Git Integration - Stage, Commit, Push from VS Code GUI


**Instructions (VS Code GUI):**

* VS Code has excellent built-in Git integration. Look for the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar (usually the third icon down - looks like branching lines). _ICON_BOSATE_HOBEY_
* Click on the Source Control icon. You should see hello_script.py listed under 'Changes' – this is your working directory in Git terms.
* **Stage Changes**: Hover over hello_script.py in the 'Changes' section and click the '+' (Stage Changes) icon that appears next to it. Or, click the '+' icon at the top of the 'Source Control' panel to stage all changes."
* **Commit Changes:** In the text box at the top of the Source Control panel, type your commit message: feat: Run hello_script.py locally in VS Code. Click the 'Commit' button (Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter, or the checkmark icon)."

## Explore the Power of Auto Code Completion
VS Code - IntelliSense: Your Intelligent Coding Assistant

**Demonstration:**
1. In VS Code, open hello_script.py.
2. Go to the end of the greet function and start typing pri...
> Observe how VS Code's IntelliSense pops up suggestions, like print(), property(), etc. (pore screenshot debo)
3. Select print from the suggestions (using arrow keys and Enter or Tab).
4. VS Code auto-completes print() and even provides parameter hints when you open the parentheses "(".
> Type "IntelliSense is..." inside the parentheses."
5. Run the script again from the VS Code terminal (`python hello_script.py`). You should see your new print statement's output."
6. **IntelliSense dramatically speeds up coding, reduces typos, and helps you discover available functions and methods.**

### It's a hallmark of modern code editors and a key to professional productivity.
-----

## VS Code - Explore Linting & Formatting (PEP 8 Checks)
Linting & Formatting: Automated Code Style Checks

**Demonstration:**
1. In hello_script.py, intentionally introduce a few minor PEP 8 violations:
> Add two spaces instead of four for indentation in a line.
> Remove the space around the = operator in an assignment.
Make a line too long (exceeding 79 characters).
2. Save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`).
3. Observe how VS Code immediately highlights these PEP 8 violations with underlines or markers in the editor.
> Hover over a marker – VS Code will show you the PEP 8 error code (e.g., E111 for indentation, E225 for missing whitespace around operator, E501 for line too long).
> Right-click in the editor and select 'Format Document' (or use the shortcut `Shift+Alt+F` or `Shift+Option+F`). If you have a formatter like black or autopep8 configured (the Python extension usually prompts you to install one), VS Code will *automatically format your code to PEP 8 standards!

## VS Code - Explore Linting & Formatting (PEP 8 Checks)
Linting & Formatting: Automated Code Style Checks

**Demonstration (cntd.):**

4. Run `flake8 hello_script.py` in the VS Code terminal. 
> You should see that flake8 now reports no errors or warnings because VS Code's formatting corrected the PEP 8 issues.


### **Automated linting and formatting are essential for maintaining code quality and PEP 8 compliance in professional projects. VS Code makes it incredibly easy to integrate these tools into your workflow.**

## Collaboration Workflow -  Simulated Teamwork: Fork & Pull Request (Conceptual)
A simplified Intro on Forking and Pull Requests

GitHub enables powerful collaboration using **branches and Pull Requests (PRs)**. Let's understand the basic idea, even if we are working individually for now.

#### Imagine you are working in a team on a larger project, hosted on GitHub"

- **Branching:** To work on a new feature or bug fix, you don't directly change the main project code. Instead, you create a branch – a copy of the main codebase where you can work in isolation." (pore diagram debo on branching off from 'main').
- **Forking (*in a real collaborative scenario*)**: If you are contributing to someone else's project (e.g., open source), you would first 'fork' their repository – create your own copy of their repo on GitHub."

-----

## Collaboration Workflow -  Simulated Teamwork: Fork & Pull Request (Conceptual)
A simplified Intro on Forking and Pull Requests

- **Pull Request:** After you've made changes in your branch (or fork) and want to merge them back into the main project (or original repository), you create a Pull Request (or Merge Request). This is a request to the project maintainers to review your changes and pull them into the main codebase." (merging er diagram marmaid diye banabo).
- **Code Review:** In a PR, team members can review your code, provide feedback, suggest improvements before it gets merged. This is a crucial step for code quality and catching errors early."
- **Merging:** Once your code is reviewed and approved, it's merged into the main branch, becoming part of the project."

### We'll practice branching and merging locally in VS Code in the next modules, and later explore real collaborative workflows with Pull Requests on GitHub.

## Git Deep Dive - `git init`: Starting a New Repository
Laying the Foundation for Version Control

### **Explanation:**

  * `git init` is the very first command you'll use when starting a new project that you want to put under version control with Git.
  * It initializes a *new, empty Git repository* in the directory where you run the command.
  * What it does:
      * Creates a hidden `.git` subdirectory within your project directory.
      * The `.git` directory is the *heart* of your Git repository. It stores all the version history, configuration, and metadata for your project.
      * After `git init`, your project directory becomes a *working directory* connected to a Git repository, ready for version control.
  * You only need to run `git init` **once** per project, at the very beginning.

-----
## Git Deep Dive - `git init`: Starting a New Repository
Laying the Foundation for Version Control

### **Important:** `git init` is for starting version control in a *local* directory. To connect to a remote repository (like on GitHub), you'll use `git remote add` (later).

-----
## Git Deep Dive - `git init`: Starting a New Repository
Laying the Foundation for Version Control

**Code Demo:**

```bash
""" In your VS Code terminal 
(ensure you are NOT inside your 'pro-python-scripts' repo for this demo, 
maybe navigate to your Documents or Desktop)"""

mkdir my_new_project_demo
cd my_new_project_demo
git init

# Expected Output (similar to):
# Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my_new_project_demo/.git/

ls -a  # List all files, including hidden ones (on macOS/Linux)
# or
dir /a # On Windows

# You should see the hidden '.git' directory listed in the output
